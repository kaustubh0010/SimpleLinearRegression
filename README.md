# Simple Linear Regression

## Project Overview
This project demonstrates the implementation of **Simple Linear Regression** using Python. Simple Linear Regression is a statistical method that allows us to summarize and study relationships between two continuous variables.

## Key Features
- Data preprocessing and visualization
- Model training using Simple Linear Regression
- Model evaluation with performance metrics
- Visualization of regression results

## Technologies Used
- Python
- Pandas
- Matplotlib / Seaborn (for data visualization

## Installation
1. Clone this repository:
   ```bash
   git clone <repository-url>
   ```
2. Navigate to the project directory:
   ```bash
   cd SimpleLinearRegression
   ```
3. Install the required dependencies:
   ```bash
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```

## Usage
1. Open the Jupyter Notebook:
   ```bash
   jupyter notebook SimpleLinearRegression.ipynb
   ```
2. Run the cells step-by-step to:
   - Load and preprocess the dataset
   - Train the Simple Linear Regression model
   - Evaluate and visualize the model's performance

## Results
The model outputs a regression line fitted to the data, along with evaluation metrics such as:
- Mean Squared Error (MSE)
- R-squared (R²) Score
